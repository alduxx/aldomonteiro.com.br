*Percy Bysshe Shelley*

I met a traveler from an antique land  
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown   
And wrinkled lips, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Whitch yet survive, stamped on those lifeless things  
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.  
And on the pedestal These words appear --  
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:  
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"  
Nothing besides remains. Round the decay   
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
