I started tinkering with computers in 1993 and never stopped.

Currently working as an Staff Engineer in Brasília, Brazil. 

Besides design and programming, I enjoy playing the guitar, cooking spicy food, reading fiction books and poetry. You can find an assortment of [my favorite poems here](/poetry).

I recently found that I'm in the spectrum and since then, trying to find [stuff that brings me some meaning](/act).
